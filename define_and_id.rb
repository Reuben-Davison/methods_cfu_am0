# Run each line of code below (either from this file or in IRB individually).
#  Then, in a ruby comment, write 1-2 sentences describing what is happening, using ALL the involved vocabulary terms you've learned in this lesson so far.

# EXAMPLE
# The upcase method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed; upcase has one clear job which is to capitalize all letters that exist in the String
# The return value is "HI"
"Hello World".upcase
#this method makes all the leters capitalized

"Hello World".include?("Hello")
#method is asking if the string includes the arugument "Hello"

"Hello World".end_with?("Hello")
#end_with method is seeing if the string concludes with the argument

"Hello World".end_with?("rld")
# this is the same situating but it is illustrating that the argument doesn't need
#a full portion of the string to call the method

"Hello World".length
#there is no argument, just a method that calls on number of characters in the string

"Hello World".size
#same as above, but shows that differently named methods can perform the same function.
