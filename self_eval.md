# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
more practice is definitely needed. I struggled way too much over little syntax issues.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
The concept is easy to grasp of what is going on, it is the trying to come up with my own solutions that I am struggling with.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
Once I figure them out, there is really no more questions. I think I am going to need to spend some more time on these though.
